```
Executes a command in the background, similarly to nohup, but without
echoing messages to the console by default, and without appending output
to a log file.

Syntax: BackgroundExec [options] <command> [arguments]

Available options are:
  -h, --help                This help
  -v, --verbose             Run in verbose mode


```
