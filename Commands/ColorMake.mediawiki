In default GoboLinux systems, "make" is an alias to ColorMake.


== Multiple CPUs ==

Users on dual-core and similar high-end machines may want to take advantage of 
existing CPU capabilities. This can either be done via the MAKEOPTS option
or by modifying the simple ColorMake script.

At

  makecmd=

Edit the line to i.e.:
  makecmd='/bin/make -j5'

About the -j5 part, the rule of thumb is that the number after -j should equal  
the number of your cores +1: on a typical dual-core machine, the number would be 3.
