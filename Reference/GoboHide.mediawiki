To simplify the users' view of filesystem,
GoboHide conceals legacy unix directories such as /usr,
/lib, /sbin, and /etc, which contain links to files placed
elsewhere under [[The GoboLinux Filesystem Hierarchy]]. 

GoboHide works by hooking directory read operations
directly in the root of the problem: since every readdir()
call is translated and performed by the kernel, we have
added a list which is kept in kernel, checking every
readdir() operation. If the current inode being read is
stored in this list, then it simply doesn't get copied onto
the destination buffer, which should be returned to the
user.

The user's interface to the GoboHide ioctl's is through a
userspace tool, called '''gobohide''', and has the following
options:

<pre>
gobohide --help

gobohide: Hide/Unhide a directory

-h, --hide     Hide the directory
-u, --unhide   Unhide the directory
-l, --list     List the hidden directories
--version  Show the program version
--help     Show this message
</pre>

In order to hide a directory, one would need to run gobohide
with '-h', passing the target entry. A subsequent "ls" will
not show the hidden entry, then:

<pre>
ls /

Depot  Mount     System bin  etc  proc  sys  usr
Files  Programs  Users  dev  lib  sbin  tmp  var

gobohide -h /usr
gobohide -h /etc

ls /

Depot  Mount     System  bin  lib   sbin  tmp
Files  Programs  Users   dev  proc  sys   var
</pre>

This allows entries to be ''really'' hidden from the
filesystem. But don't worry, this can be only performed by
the superuser, and he/she has power to ask the kernel for
the entries being hidden. This ensures that nothing gets
hidden without the superuser's conscience:

<pre>
gobohide -l

Hidden directories:
/etc
/usr
</pre>

And the best of it all: you can still access your files
inside these hidden entries, and even bash would tell you
that files exist in these directories:

<pre>
if [ -f /etc/fstab ]; then echo "okay"; fi
okay

ls /etc/zshrc

rwxrwxrwx  28 /etc/zshrc -> /Programs/ZSH/Settings/zshrc
========================================================
28 in 1 file - 7614808 kB used (96%), 388760 kB free
</pre>

GoboHide currently supports hiding entries on any mounted
filesystem. Because it is implemented at the level of the
Linux virtual filesystem, it is independent of specific
filesystems.
