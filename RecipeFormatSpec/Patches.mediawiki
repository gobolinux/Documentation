== Patches ==
Patches are applied in filename order, with the '-p1' option.  Creation by
 diff -Naur old_dir new_dir
or
 diff -Nau old_file new_file
works well. They should be named '01-explanation.patch',
where the initial numbers increase in the order for patches to be applied,
and ''explanation'' is a short title giving some inkling of the patch's purpose.
Additionally, the first few lines of the patch (before the
 --- foo/1.0/file.bad
 +++ foo/1.0/file.good
lines) should contain an explanation of why the patch is necessary.
GoboLinux avoids patches to add features or optimizations;
patches should fix compilation or installation, or true bugs.

=== Dynamic patches ===
These patches are modified by Compile prior to being applied.
They should be named '''01-explanation.patch.in'''.
The [[#Dynamic variables|dynamic variables]] may be used, prefixed with the string ''''@%Compile_'''' and postfixed with ''''%@''''. Such variables include (where the Program being compiled has some dependency ''Foo''):
* @%Compile_target%@
* @%Compile_settings_target%@
* @%Compile_variable_target%@
* @%Compile_foo_path%@
* @%Compile_foo_settings_path%@
* @%Compile_foo_variable_path%@
