== Hooks ==

Besides the declarative variables, recipes can also contain imperative commands, in the form of bash shell functions. This is the order the functions are called for each recipe type:

Note: pre_patch will not be called if there are no patches.

==== configure: ====
* '''pre_patch()'''
* patch, if any
* '''pre_build()'''
* configure
* make
* '''pre_install()'''
* make install
* '''pre_link()'''
* symlink
* '''post_install()'''

==== cabal: ====
* '''pre_patch()'''
* patch, if any
* cabal configure (affected by "$runhaskell" and "$cabal_options")
* '''pre_build()'''
* cabal build (affected by "$runhaskell")
* '''pre_install()'''
* cabal install (affected by "$runhaskell")
* symlink
* '''post_install()'''

==== makefile: ====
* '''pre_patch()'''
* patch, if any
* '''pre_build()'''
* make
* '''pre_install()'''
* make install
* '''pre_link()'''
* symlink
* '''post_install()'''

==== manifest: ====
* '''pre_patch()'''
* patch, if any
* '''pre_install()'''
* copy files
* '''pre_link()'''
* symlink
* '''post_install()'''

==== python: ====
* '''pre_patch()'''
* patch, if any
* '''pre_build()'''
* python setup.py build
* '''pre_install()'''
* python setup.py install
* '''pre_link()'''
* symlink
* '''post_install()'''

==== scons: ====
* '''pre_patch()'''
* patch, if any
* '''pre_build()'''
* scons.py
* '''pre_install()'''
* scons.py install
* '''pre_link()'''
* symlink
* '''post_install()'''

==== xmkmf: ====
* '''pre_patch()'''
* patch, if any
* '''pre_build()'''
* xmkmf
* make
* '''pre_install()'''
* make install
* '''pre_link()'''
* symlink
* '''post_install()'''

=== Private shell functions ===

For shell functionality to be shared, for example between sub-recipes of different architectures, it is possible to define additional shell functions in the recipe. Their names must be prefixed with '''private__'''.

=== Use flag hooks ===
Additional shell functions
'''using_<flag>()''' will be run for each use flag ''flag'' which is set.
Do not do anything in such a function which depends on time of execution.  Instead, use
''using_<flag>_<hook>()''.  For instance, ''using_gtk_pre_build()'' is run at the time specified above,
in the event that the ''gtk'' use flag is set.

See [[Use flags]].

== New Hooks ==

Since version 1.12.0, Compile supports a new set of hooks. These hooks can be used to override any of the steps in the compilation process, and are available to all recipe types. As with the "old" hooks discussed above, the new hooks shouldn't be necessary for most recipe types, but they are useful for cases in which the compilation process needs to perform nonstandard steps.

In order of invocation, these are the new hooks:

* do_fetch()
* do_unpack()
* do_patch()
* do_configuration()
* do_build()
* do_install()

If any of these hooks are defined in your recipe, Compile will call it instead of performing the standard corresponding step for the recipe type you are using. So, for instance, if your recipe needs to perform the installation step in some nonstandard way, your recipe should include something like this:

  do_install() {
    # ... your code for nonstandard installation goes here ...
  }

Notice that this will ''not'' perform the standard configuration steps. If you need to perform some nonstandard steps ''in addition to'' the standard steps, you can call the default Compile functions from your own hook. The function that performs the default installation step for recipes of type manifest, for instance, is called <tt>manifest_do_install()</tt>. Using it would look like this:

  do_install() {
    # Perform the regular installation (for recipes with manifest type)
    manifest_do_install "$@"
    
    # Perform some additional, nonstandard steps
    # ... some ...
    # ... nonstandard ...
    # ... installation ...
    # ... steps ...
    # ... here ...
  }
