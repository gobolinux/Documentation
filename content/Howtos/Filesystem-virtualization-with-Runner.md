[Runner]({{%relref "Runner" %}}) is a utility for launching programs under
GoboLinux that ensures that the filesystem view of a process will match its
dependencies. In other words, Runner eliminates the possibility of library
conflicts when running an executable.

Runner is a filesystem virtualization tool that sets up a constrained view of
`/System/Index` for a process based on the executable program's `Dependencies`
file. It is run as a wrapper, e.g. `Runner SomeApp`.

Runner builds a custom mount table for the process, like container tools do, but
without duplicating files. It dynamically picks the correct parts of your
`/Programs` tree. This approach is feasible in GoboLinux due to way programs are
each confined to their own subdirectories.

## Preparing the filesystem view

All you have to do is to make sure the dependencies of the program you want to
run are correctly listed under the program's [Resources
directory]({{%relref "Recipe-Format-Specification#resources" %}}) - more
specifically, in the
[Dependencies]({{%relref "Recipe-Format-Specification#dependencies" %}}) file at
`/Programs/Name/Version/Resources/Dependencies`. You may list program names
(e.g., `LibPNG`), specify a particular version (as in `LibPNG 1.4.4`) or even
let Runner pick the best version given a certain range (e.g.,
`LibPNG >= 1.4.0, < 1.5.0`).

Most likely, the program you want to run will already have a sane `Dependencies`
file - every binary package we distribute will have one, just like every
compilation recipe do.

## The Compile tool

Compile makes use of Runner to control the environment for building software
packages. When you type `Compile Foo`, Compile fetches the recipe for Foo and
passes both the `Dependencies` and `BuildDependencies` files of that recipe to
Runner. This ensure that the right versions of the libraries, headers, and
executables needed by that package will be mapped onto `/System/Index`.

## Spawning an application with Runner

For regular GoboLinux packages, simply type `Runner application_name`. Runner
will figure from which entry under `/Programs` `application_name` comes from,
and will create a custom filesystem view for that application by overlaying its
dependencies over `/System/Index`.

For non-regular GoboLinux packages, such as third-party executables downloaded
on your home directory, you can hand-craft a `Dependencies` file and then
provide that file to Runner, as in
`Runner -d MyDependenciesFile ./third_party_app`.

## Multi-arch setups

Running a 32-bit application on a 64-bit distro is no different with Runner.
Provided that you have the 32-bit dependencies installed under `/Programs` (such
as `Glibc/2.18-i686` and `Bash/3.1-i686`), the `Dependencies` file of your
program simply needs to state the versions of the 32-bit packages it relies on.
Afterwards, simply type `Runner <application_name>` and you are all set.
