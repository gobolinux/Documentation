title: "UpdateKdeRecipe"
---

The `UpdateKdeRecipe` script is assumingly aiding in updating KDE recipes.

It is a component of the Scripts collection and will normally reside under the
`Scripts/bin` subdirectory.

It was in particular useful for the qt3/kde3 stack several years ago - presently
(Sep 2017) it may need some modifications due to upstream changes to kde.
