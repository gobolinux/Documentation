title: "BackgroundExec"
---

Executes a command in the background, similarly to nohup, but without echoing
messages to the console by default, and without appending output to a log file.

```
Syntax: BackgroundExec [options] <command> [arguments]

Available options are:
  -h, --help                This help
  -v, --verbose             Run in verbose mode
```
