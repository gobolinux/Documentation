Note that NamingConventions is part of the `Scripts` package. You can find in
the `bin/` subdirectory there.

Here are some usage examples; note that presently `NamingConventions` appears to
prefer only the program name, so if you have a full remote URL, make sure to
only pass the name of the program towards `NamingConventions`.

```fish
NamingConventions glib => GLib
```
