We greatly value community contributions to our wiki! If you notice any gaps or errors in the documentation, you have the power to make a difference!

Simply click the edit button ✏️ in the top right corner of any wiki article to access an editable form on GitHub. We use Markdown formatting, by the way.

The wiki's content and source code are housed in a dedicated repository on [Github](https://github.com/gobolinux/Documentation).

Check out the README for guidance on navigating the wiki's code, or feel free to file an issue if you need assistance!
