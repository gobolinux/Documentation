title: "Upgrade Glibc"
---

## Question:

Hi, has anyone got any hints for glibc? I compiled `2.5.1` into
`/Programs/Glibc/2.5.1` but which step should i do next?

(Ideally this should be expanded... i have static versions of tar, bzip, bash,
coreutils, binutils, make, but if i symlink brutally then ncurses has some
links, so I probably need to do something differently.)

## Answer:

I was in an even worse situation, since I was using a dynamic version of those
programs. I totally trashed my system: every single program would segfault, and
then the kernel started to panic at boot time. But I've found a solution which
can be used either to fix the above ailment, or to cleanly install a new
`Glibc`.

1. Boot using the live-CD.

2. Mount your root partition to `/Mount/Media`:

    ```fish
    mount /dev/hda6 /Mount/Media
    ```

3. Install the version of `Glibc` you want. Note that the `-r` is essential,
   otherwise your `/Systems/Index/bin` links will point to subdirectories of
   `/Mount/Media`, which won't be mounted anymore after you reboot.
    ```fish
    goboPrefix="/Mount/Media" SymlinkProgram -r Glibc 2.5.1
    ```
4. Relink against the new `Glibc`. If you forget this step, all non
   statically-linked programs will segfault. If your boot process involves any
   (which it probably does), you won't even be able to reboot!
    ```fish
    chroot /Mount/Media ldconfig -v
    ```

To make this relatively painless, make sure to compile `Glibc` with using this
command

```fish
Compile -l no Glibc
```

as it will stop `Compile` from symlinking `Glibc` after a successful compile and
install.
