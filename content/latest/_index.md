> [!CAUTION] Caution: Limited Maintainance (01/01/2026)
> GoboLinux is currently in "maintainance mode". What does this mean?
> At the moment there is only one developer working on GoboLinux and
> at the moment this developer (myself) got other IRL stuff to tend to.
> Please refrain from reporting issues unless you are willing to *actively*
> fix them yourself (I will provide limited support).
> 
> Please refrain from posting feature request (these will be closed).
> If you are ready to work on GoboLinux *yourself* you are highly encouraged to do so.
> This project is **not** dead, it needs active maintainers. The state you ***will***
> experience will most closely rememble an "Alpha"-state.
> When will "maintainence mode" be over? At least once I release GoboLinux 017.02
> or even 020 (the next one in line).
> 
> Why? Because people come to GoboLinux with the *wrong expectations* and it is
> actively taking up time and energy that would better be invested elsewhere...
> Trust me: most issues we have at the moment are _**known**_. We (as in: me, and
> some occasional helpers) just didn't get around to adress them. This will happen
> within the next releases — at which point posting bug reports and feature requests will
> be highly welcomed again :)) Have fun!!

## Welcome to this wiki !

Hello and welcome to the official documentation and wiki of the GoboLinux
project!

GoboLinux is [quite](https://gobolinux.org/k5.html)
[different](https://gobolinux.org/at_a_glance.html) from your usual linux
distribution. Therefore to make your journey as enjoyable possible, you should
carefully **read** and **consult** the documentation.

If you have just installed GoboLinux on your PC, make sure to check out the
[Known Issues and Fixes]({{%relref "GoboLinux-Known-Issues-and-Fixes" %}})
section first.

## How to find your way around

You can begin with the [**Getting Started**]({{%relref "Getting-Started" %}}) section on the
left. This should get you going. You can use your `←left`/`right→` for
navigation. Or make use of our full-text search!

The [**Advanced**]({{%relref "Advanced" %}}) section contains some
further and advanced topics , but if you're serious about your GoboLinux journey
you should read this one, too!

The [**How-To's**]({{%relref "How-tos" %}}) section holds articles to solve a specific
problem and guides you through step-by-step. We rely heavily on community
contributions here. If you feel something important is not covered, be
encouraged to submit your contribution!

The [**Commands**]({{%relref "Commands" %}}) section is a list of GoboLinux
specific commands and tooling, that will make your life with GoboLinux much
easier. They are what makes GoboLinux so enjoyable and are very much in the
spirit of: **_„Do One Thing and Do It Well!”_**.

### Couldn't find what you were looking for?

GoboLinux is a very broad project, that has its roots back to 2002!
Thus you may find outdated or even missing documentation... but do not
despair!!

Our community is here to help you out. If you have read the documentation but
still require further assistance, reach out to us on:

-   **IRC chat:** [#gobolinux](irc://irc.libera.chat/gobolinux) at
    irc.libera.chat (slow channel, please be patient and wait up to 24h for a response!)
-   **Our forums:** https://github.com/orgs/gobolinux/discussions

Please be patient, we are a small community but we do make an effort to help
everybody out.

## Expectations

As an experimental distribution, you might run into some bugs along the way. We encourage you to tackle these
challenges on your own or with the support of our friendly community. While we can't promise everything will be
handed to you, your discoveries and solutions are invaluable to us—please share them!

If you find this documentation to be lacking in any regard please refer to [this]({{%relref "Contributing-to-the-wiki" %}}) article.

GoboLinux thrives on the
passion and contributions of its users, and together, we can make it even better.

Your exciting journey with GoboLinux has just begun! ![gobo](images/favicon.png)
