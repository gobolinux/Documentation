Compiled programs in C and C++ typically have a `lib/` directory and often also
a `bin/` directory.

On **GoboLinux**, these will be symlinked into `/System/Index` such as for ping:

    /System/Index/bin/ping
    /System/Index/lib/libpng.so.3

Traditional Unix paths are also symlinks to the `/System/Index` directory
structure:

    /bin     -> /System/Index/bin
    /usr/bin -> /System/Index/bin
    /usr/lib -> /System/Index/lib
    /etc     -> /System/Settings
