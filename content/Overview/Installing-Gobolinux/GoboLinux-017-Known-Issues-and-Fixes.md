## Live environment

### Running Compile

Install `UnionFS-Fuse` to workaround limitations with the sandbox in the Live
environment:

```fish
InstallPackage --no-check-certificate https://gobolinux.org/packages/017/Fuse--2.9.7--x86_64.tar.bz2
InstallPackage --no-check-certificate https://gobolinux.org/packages/017/UnionFS-Fuse--2.1--x86_64.tar.bz2
```

## Installed system

### Git-related errors when invoking Compile for the first time

Loopback network interface needs to be brought up. As root, run:

```fish
ifconfig lo up
echo ifconfig lo up >> /System/Settings/BootScripts/BootUp
```

### InstallPackage searches for packages from GoboLinux 016 rather than 017

Update the search URL used by the `Scripts` package:

```fish
GrepReplace -B "016" "017" /System/Settings/Scripts/GetAvailable.conf
```

### Update of Compile and Scripts tools

`Compile` and `Scripts` are always evolving. Make sure to update your copies by
running the following commands after you boot into your installed system for the
first time:

```fish
cd /Programs/Scripts/Current
git pull && UpdateSettings --auto Scripts && make

cd /Programs/Compile/Current
git pull && UpdateSettings --auto Compile
```

### Dependencies files with reference to Ncurses

`Ncurses` has been replaced by `NcursesW`, but some packages' metadata still
hold references to the former. The following command fixes that:

```fish
GrepReplace -B "^Ncurses " "NcursesW " /Programs/*/*/Resources/Dependencies
```

### Update expired SSL certificates!

The recent
[Let's Encrypt fiasko](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/pyce7q/sept_29th_lets_encrypt_intermediate_ca_expiration/)
requires our users to update their certificate database on the system. Otherwise
tools like `git`, `wget`, `Compile` etc might not work correctly.

The appropriate way to resolve this, is by running:

```fish
sudo Compile --no-check-certificate Automake
sudo Compile --no-check-certificate CA-Certificates
```

and

```fish
sudo sh /System/Index/bin/update-ca-certificates
```

afterwards.

### Wrong version of SQLite

The version under `/Programs/SQLite/3310100` is actually `3.8.2`. Please run the
following commands to update to its most recent version:

```fish
Compile SQLite
RemoveProgram SQLite 3310100
```

### Outstanding issues

Some problems have been reported by our users and are currently being fixed by
our team. They are:

-   `ContributePackage` is not working -- use
    [ContributeRecipe]({{%relref "GitHub-contributor-workflow" %}}) instead.
-   Copy-and-paste does not work out of the box from a VM. Compiling
    `spice-vdagent` and loading its daemon should fix that.
-   Sometimes when trying to `Compile` an already-installed Program, the build
    process will fail (see
    [Compile bug 51](https://github.com/gobolinux/Compile/issues/51)). Sometimes
    this can be worked around by first manually doing a
    `RemoveProgram <failing program>` before re-attempting to `Compile` it. Note
    that it is generally a _**Bad Ideaâ„¢**_ to try to `RemoveProgram`, say,
    `Python3` like this as it will break `Compile`.

### Compile fails stating that some headers or libraries could not be found, when they are there

The installation process used by Compile had a problem in that certain extended
attributes used by `overlayfs` were carried over from the sandbox to the
installation directory. Some of those extended attributes tell `overlayfs` to
consider the corresponding files or directories as deleted objects. Since we use
`overlayfs` to sandbox the compilation process, this bug may impact Compile in
the sense that existing files may be considered as non-existent.

If you face this problem, please run the following commands on your installed
system to remove those attributes:

```shell
fname=
xattr_pattern="trusted.overlay."
getfattr -P -R -d -m "$xattr_pattern" --absolute-names /Programs 2> /dev/null | while read i
do
   if echo "$i" | grep -q "^# file:"
   then
      fname="$(echo "$i" | awk {'print $3'})"
   elif echo "$i" | grep -q "^${xattr_pattern}"
   then
      xattr="$(echo "$i" | cut -d= -f1)"
      setfattr --remove "$xattr" "$fname"
   fi
done
```
