Normally, you shouldn't need to compile "manually", i.e., without using the
[`Compile`]({{%relref "Compile" %}}) tool. However, it is possible to manually run
the same commands that `Compile` uses.

## Overview

Compiling programs in Linux is typically a three-part process: prepare the
sources with `./configure`, compile them with `make`, and install the compiled
program with `make install`.

To this process, Gobo adds a source configuration step to target the GoboLinux
directory structure, and after the install phase, a step that symlinks the files
from the application directory under `/Programs` to `/System/Index`. It is this
last step that makes programs "visible" to the GoboLinux system.

These are the relevant commands:

-   [`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}})
-   [`SandboxInstall`]({{%relref "SandboxInstall" %}})
-   [`SymlinkProgram`]({{%relref "SymlinkProgram" %}})

[`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}}) is a wrapper to the first step
described above. [`SandboxInstall`]({{%relref "SandboxInstall" %}}) is a wrapper to
the third step, ensuring safe execution of `make install`.
[`SymlinkProgram`]({{%relref "SymlinkProgram" %}}) performs the final operations
that integrate the new program into the system.

## Setting up the sources: PrepareProgram

The [`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}}) script does two things. It
creates a directory hierarchy for the program under `/Programs`, and it attempts
to prepare the sources for compilation.

The syntax for the [`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}}) is:.

```fish
PrepareProgram <program-name> <version-number> [ -- <additional-options> ]
```

Passing a program name and version number is mandatory. These names are the ones
used in the directories under programs. For example,

```fish
PrepareProgram --tree Foo 1.0
```

(the `--tree` switch) creates the directories `/Programs/Foo/Settings`,
`/Programs/Foo/1.0`, `/Programs/Foo/1.0/bin` and so on.

The second task performed by [`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}}) is
to prepare the sources. Since there isn't a standardized format for distribution
of source-code tarballs in the free software world, there is no way to implement
completely automated preparation. Fortunately, the popularization of the GNU
AutoTools brings us much closer.

[`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}}), in this second step, will
detect availability of preparation tools and perform one of the following:

1.  If the program includes a `configure` script generated by GNU autoconf,
    [`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}}) will run it, passing the
    necessary options (mainly `--prefix`, `--sysconfdir`) as well as any
    additional options requested by the user in the command line (as
    `<additional-options>`).
2.  Some authors develop their own `configure` scripts, but due to the
    popularity of GNU autoconf, design a command line interface similar to that
    used by autoconf. [`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}}) tries to
    detect if a non-autoconf `configure` script accepts at least the `--prefix`
    option, and uses it.

In short, [`PrepareProgram`]({{%relref "PrepareProgram" %}}) can be considered a
wrapper to `configure`. Instead of running, for example,

```fish
cd foo-1.0
./configure --with-shared=yes
```

you'll run

```fish
cd foo-1.0
PrepareProgram Foo 1.0 -- --with-shared=yes
```

## SandboxInstall

Strictly speaking, if everything were configured correctly you could simply run
`make` and `make install`, and all files would be installed under the
appropriate subdirectory under `Programs/`.

To ensure this happens is to guarantee the modularity of the software
installation.

To prevent any possibility of files being copied elsewhere in the directory tree
than the target under `/Programs`, GoboLinux conducts the install step in a
"sandbox" that is isolated from the rest of the filesystem.

[`SandboxInstall`]({{%relref "SandboxInstall" %}}) constructs a container for
`make install`. It uses a sandbox provided by the
[`FiboSandbox`]({{%relref "FiboSandbox" %}}) script, which configures custom
permissions for an allowed set of paths to a special user,
[`fibo`]({{%relref "Fibo" %}}). On systems with a UnionFS backend (such as
FunionFS, UnionFS-FUSE or OverlayFS), the sandbox is provided by the alternative
script [`UnionSandbox`]({{%relref "UnionSandbox" %}}). Installation then runs
confined to a sandbox, with no permission to write anywhere but the few places
[`SandboxInstall`]({{%relref "SandboxInstall" %}}) allows it to, such as
`/Programs/Foo/Current` and `/Programs/Foo/Settings`. Therefore, no files can be
installed in "random places". A typical call to
[`SandboxInstall`]({{%relref "SandboxInstall" %}}) looks like this:

```fish
SandboxInstall Foo 1.0
```

If necessary, additional options can be passed. Refer to the [ `SandboxInstall`
reference page]({{%relref "SandboxInstall" %}}) for details.

## Linking the sources: SymlinkProgram

The final step in the compilation of a program is performed by the
[`SymlinkProgram`]({{%relref "SymlinkProgram" %}}). This is the script responsible
for creating the symbolic links under `/System/Index`.

The syntax for [`SymlinkProgram`]({{%relref "SymlinkProgram" %}}) is:

```fish
SymlinkProgram program-name [ version-number ]
```

The second argument is optional. If no version number is specified, the one
linked as `Current` will be used. A commonly used command-line parameter is `-c`
`overwrite`, which tells it to overwrite any existing symlinks in case of
conflicts (the default action is to preserve the existing links in order to not
affect previously existing applications). To integrate a program `Foo` into the
`/System` structure, overwriting any links, you would type:

```fish
SymlinkProgram -c overwrite Foo
```

[`SymlinkProgram`]({{%relref "SymlinkProgram" %}}) features many command-line
switches, to cover more advanced needs. You can refer to the [ `SymlinkProgram`
reference page]({{%relref "SymlinkProgram" %}}) for details if necessary.
