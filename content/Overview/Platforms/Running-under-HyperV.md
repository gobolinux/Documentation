When running the GoboLinux 016.01 live ISO through Hyper-V, you will notice that
`startx` does not start correctly by default. You can fix this by adding a
kernel boot parameter and creating an Xorg configuration file.

Edit `/System/Kernel/Boot/grub/grub.cfg` and find the kernel boot line. Change
`video=vesafb:off` to `video=hyperv_fb:1024x768` and save it. You may wish to
try this part in advance first, without saving it; in that case, press `e` at
the Grub menu, make this same edit, and press `Ctrl`-`X` to boot once only with
the new command line.

Run `X -configure`. It will generate a file `xorg.conf.new`. Edit this file, and
change `vesa` to `fbdev`. Move the file to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`.

Reboot. `startx` will now work normally.
