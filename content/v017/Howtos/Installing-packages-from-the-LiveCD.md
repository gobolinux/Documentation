title: "Installing Packages from the LiveCD"
---

After installing GoboLinux and booting from the hard disk, you may want to
choose software packages from the Live CD to install. To do so, you must mount
the `squashfs` file that contains the image from the Live CD system.

To do that, first mount the CD then mount the desired GoboLinux squashfs file:

```fish
mount /Mount/CD-ROM
mount /Mount/CD-ROM/GoboLinux-NonBase.squashfs /Mount/ SquashFS -t squashfs -o loop=/System/Kernel/Devices/loop0`
```

Now, you can use [`InstallPackage`]({{%relref "InstallPackage" %}}) to install
software from the `Program/` directory of the Live-CD:

```fish
InstallPackage /Mount/SquashFS/Programs/Inkscape
```

**Note 1:** after using the squashfs file, you may want unmount it:

```fish
umount /Mount/SquashFS
```

**Note 2:** To have the dependencies required by an application installed
automatically, use the `--batch` or `-b` parameter:

```fish
InstallPackage --batch Gimp
```

**-or-**

```fish
InstallPackage --batch /Mount/SquashFS/Programs/Gimp
```
