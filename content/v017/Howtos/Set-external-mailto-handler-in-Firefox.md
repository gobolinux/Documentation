linkTitle: "External Firefox mailto handler"
---

If you use Firefox and are not running it in KDE or Gnome you'll often times
find that mailto: links don't always or never get handled the way you would
like. If you're interested in setting Firefox to handle mailto: links with an
external program of any kind, here is how you do it:

1.  Open Firefox
2.  In the address bar go to the page <about:config>
3.  First look for the value of `network.protocol-handler.expose.mailto` and set
    it to `true`
    1.  If the value doesn't exists right-click and under "New" choose Boolean,
        then set the name and value to `true`
4.  Second look for the value of `network.protocol-handler.app.mailto` and set
    it to the application you want handling your mail.
    1.  As with the previous value, if it doesn't exist: right-click and under
        "New" choose String, then set it to the value of the application you
        want handling mail.
    2.  ex. `/System/Index/bin/xmail`

#### Notes

Some useful ways of using this method is to establish a script to launch a web
service as your default means of sending email. A simple script to handle that
would be:

_for the gmail service_

```fish
. GoboPath
TO=$(echo $1 | sed 's/mailto://')
URL="https://mail.google.com/mail?view=cm&tf=0&to=${TO}"
```
