title: "Package Signing"

### QuickStart

First you need to create a pair of GPG keys. A nice GUI tool for this is KGpg.
This is included with recent KDE-Utils.

If you haven't used KGpg before, execing kgpg starts the "KGpg Wizard". Follow
the instructions to generate your key pair. Suggestions for key length and other
properties? I've used the default settings: 1024 and DSA/ElGamal.

After the wizard, export your public key to a file. Use
`KeyManager --import key.asc` to import the public key to Gobo's system keyring.

Now you can use `CreatePackage --sign` and `SignProgram` to create signed
packages and `/Programs`.

### Overview

Private keys are kept in the users `/.gnupg/keyrings`. Public keys, used for
verification, are kept in `/Programs/Scripts/Current/Data/gpg/goboring.gpg`.

`Resources/FileHash` is a text file containing the md5sums for each file.

`Resources/FileHash.sig` is the gpg signature for `FileHash`.
