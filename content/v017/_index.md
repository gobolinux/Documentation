## Welcome !

Hello and welcome to the official documentation and wiki of the GoboLinux
project!

GoboLinux is [quite](https://gobolinux.org/k5.html)
[different](https://gobolinux.org/at_a_glance.html) from your usual linux
distribution. Therefore to make your journey as enjoyable possible, you should
carefully **read** and **consult** the documentation.

If you have just installed GoboLinux on your PC, make sure to check out the
[Known Issues and Fixes]({{%relref "GoboLinux-017-Known-Issues-and-Fixes" %}})
section first.

## How to find your way around

You can start with the [**Overview**]({{%relref "Overview" %}}) section on the
left. This should get you started. You can use your ‚Üêleft/‚Üíright buttons to
navigate. Or use the our text search!

The main [**Documentation**]({{%relref "Documentation" %}}) section contains some
further and advanced topics , but if you're serious about your GoboLinux journey
you should read this one, too!

The [**Howtos**]({{%relref "Howtos" %}}) section holds articles to solve a specific
problem and guides you through step-by-step. We rely heavily on community
contributions here. If you feel something important is not covered, be
encouraged to submit your contribution!

The [**Commands**]({{%relref "Commands" %}}) section is a list of GoboLinux
specific commands and tooling, that will make your life with GoboLinux much
easier. They are what makes GoboLinux so enjoyable and are very much in the
spirit of: **_‚ÄûDo One Thing and Do It Well!‚Äù_**.

### Couldn't find what you were looking for?

GoboLinux is a very broad project, that has its roots back to 2002!
Thus you may find outdated or even missing documentation... but do not
despair!!
