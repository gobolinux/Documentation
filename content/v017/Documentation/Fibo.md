title: "Fibo"
---

In GoboLinux, `Fibo` is a special user that assists Gobo, the superuser, during
program installation. `Fibo` is responsible for the
[`FiboSandbox`]({{%relref "FiboSandbox" %}}), he is the only one who is given
access to it.

Fibo is similar to the Unix `nobody` user, but the fundamental difference is
while `nobody` **never** has write access to anything, Fibo is occasionally
granted write permission to selected locations (specifically, during program
installation, to the [`FiboSandbox`]({{%relref "FiboSandbox" %}}) and to the
`/Programs` entry of the program being installed).

In a standard GoboLinux system, `Fibo` is userid 21 (which is, of course, a
number of the
[Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence)).
