title: "GoboLinux FAQ"
---

The **idea** for this page is to collect and document various FAQs about
GoboLinux, that is, frequently asked questions pertaining to the project at
hand - especially when encountering problems. It is different to the mailing
list in that it should be "more general", that is, not necessarily tied to any
individual person at hand (whereas on a mailing list, you usually have
communication from one-to-one user that also eventually becomes forgotten or may
have to be asked again at a later time).

That way if a user runs into a problem, or wants to understand this or that
about GoboLinux, then this can be used as a "jumper" page to jump to the proper
documentation - either within the wiki itself, or as part of a program's --help
option or elsewhere.

The **old** FAQ can be found here:

https://gobolinux.org/faq.html

But keep in mind that this was written quite a long time ago; a lot of things
have changed including who runs/maintains/invests time to keep GoboLinux running
and so on and so forth.

The attempt for this FAQ here is to refer to the _present_ GoboLinux - the
latter is mostly to dive into history. And who knows which FAQ may be the
current one in 5 years from now (2017). :)

(The following subsection is incomplete... I just wanted to get things started
going for easy "setup"... please remove this sentence here and the ---- once
this FAQ has a few more entries answered.)

Q: How do I compile/install a program on GoboLinux?

Q: How do I uninstall a program on GoboLinux again?

Q: What is `/System/Index`?
