title: "Suggestion for a less super user reliant update process"
---

The current update process in gobolinux requires super-user privileges. This is
sub-optimal.

In the following, a rough sketch of how to remedy this is proposed.

## Add a `gobo` user/group by default

-   The primary user of the system will be added to the the `gobo` group during
    installation.
-   Add a sudoers snippet that allows members of the `gobo` group to run
    system-update related scripts with no password for convenience
-   Ensure that `/Data/Compile/{Archives,Recipes,Sources}` are reset to
    `chown -Rc gobo:gobo` and `chmod ug+rw` on each system-update related script
    run, possibly in a function (a script version of which should be part of the
    set of commands allowed to run without a sudo password for convenience).
-   Find a clever way to not clutter commands that require being run as `root`
    or `gobo` -- possibly using functions?
    -   This should make it easy to discern which commands need what privileges.
