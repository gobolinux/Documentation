When you install GoboLinux 016 on VMWare and boot it for the first time, you
will get a black screen after the GRUB boot selection menu. The underlying
problem is that the VMWare SCSI hard disk controller driver has been built as a
module on the kernel. Because of that, the virtual disk image is not recognized
and booting the installed system fails.

### Workaround

VMWare saves the virtual machine settings on a file with the `.vmx` extension.
If you have named your virtual machine "GoboLinux 016", then you will have a
file called `GoboLinux 016.vmx`. Shut down VMWare, open that file with a text
editor and replace the lines:

```ini
scsi0:1.present = "TRUE"
scsi0:1.fileName = "GoboLinux 016.vmdk"
scsi0:1.redo = ""
```

with the following:

```ini
sata0:1.present = "TRUE"
sata0:1.fileName = "GoboLinux 016.vmdk"
sata0:1.deviceType = "disk"
```

The `fileName` may look different on your machine. You will want to keep
whatever name your config file presents. Also, make sure that the following
lines do exist in the vmx file (again, `pciSlotNumber` may look different on
your vmx file):

```ini
sata0.present = "TRUE"
sata0.pciSlotNumber = "37"
```

Once you are done, save the file and launch VMWare. The system should boot up
nicely this time.
