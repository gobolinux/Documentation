`Installer` is a program included on the GoboLinux Live-ISO that installs
GoboLinux to your hard drive.

It takes care of **basic configuration**, **package selection**, and **boot
loader setup**. It can be run from the command line or via the window manager
menu.

## Graphical Install

The GoboLinux Live-ISO supports a complete graphical display environment.

In most cases, the X server automatically detects the keyboard and display
hardware, so you can start the graphical mode by typing:

```fish
startx
```

Clicking on the top-left icon brings up a menu. Look under System Tools, select
"Install GoboLinux", follow the instructions.

## Console install

Type `Installer` in the console. Note the capital "i". (GoboLinux utility
scripts are generally named with an initial capital and follow the CamelCase
convention.)
