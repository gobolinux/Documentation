       -n, --former-name <entry>

       -k, --keep-existing

              Keep existing recipe if one already exists

   Notes:
              Optimistically,  it  assumes only the version number has changed, and the compilation process is still identi‐
              cal. The generated recipe is better understood as a 'template' for the new version recipe.
