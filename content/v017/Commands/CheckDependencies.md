                      searched to match the dependencies.

                         always      - return the passed program
                         if_required - return the passed program iff type or
                                       version from the program was not passed

                         missing  - report matches only for missing packages
                         updating - report all packages (dependencies from the

                         all      - report matches for all dependencies, even
