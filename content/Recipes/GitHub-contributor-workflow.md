This page is intended to document the new GitHub workflow for contributing to
GoboLinux.

## Compile.conf and attribution

Fire up your favourite editor, open
`/Programs/Compile/Settings/Compile/Compile.conf` and edit the
`compileRecipeAuthor` key as appropriate:

```fish
# set up proper attribution for GitHub pull requests
compileRecipeAuthor="A. Random Contributor <somebody@some-email-address>"
```

If you are not comfortable using your real name, using a nick/alias is also
acceptable.

For more options, check out the dedicated
[Compile.conf]({{%relref "Compile.conf" %}}) page.

## Create a GitHub pull request using `ContributeRecipe`

In short, ContributeRecipe does the following:

-   Creates a fork of the Recipe tree on the user's GitHub space
-   Creates and checks out a branch on said fork
-   Commits the modifications to the given Recipe in said branch
-   Sends a GitHub PR to the GoboLinux project

### Set up git to use the correct user name and e-mail

Git needs to be set up to use the same git `user.name` and `user.email`
combination as the one used in `Compile.conf` in the `compileRecipeAuthor=` key.

```fish
cd
git config --global user.name "A. Random Contributor"
git config --global user.email "somebody@some-email-address"
# list the git configuration
git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email
```

### Check for changed files in the Recipes repository

It is considered good practice to double check the changes about to be committed
by ContributeRecipe:

```fish
cd /Data/Compile/Recipes
git status
# if existing files have been modified, you can run:
git diff
```

### Run `ContributeRecipe`

Once the attribution is correctly set up and the changes have been double
checked, it's time to run the `ContributeRecipe` script.

The script has been designed such that all there is to the contribution process
is to supply a name and a version to `ContributeRecipe`:

```fish
# cd into /Data/Compile/Recipes if you haven't already
sudo ContributeRecipe ExampleRecipe 0.0.1
```

{{% notice note %}} Please ensure that you use a GitHub account where your
name/alias and e-mail address has been added as a verified GitHub identity when
using `ContributeRecipe`. {{% /notice %}}

`ContributeRecipe` will prompt for your GitHub username and password a couple of
times (_see note about **2FA** below_), do its magic and the end result will be
a nice GoboLinux GitHub Pull Request which will hopefully get merged.

### Configure `hub` to use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication

As part of its first run, `ContributeRecipe` will call both `git` and `hub`
(`hub` is used to interface with the GitHub API). During this first run, `hub`
will create a GitHub API token and save it in `~/.config/hub`.

{{% notice note %}} If you have 2-Factor Authentication (**2FA**) enabled, `git`
and `hub` expect you to supply the oauth token that was saved in `~/.config/hub`
and NOT your normal password when authenticating. {{% /notice %}}

For convenience, `hub` can be set up to re-use this token for authentication
with your GitHub account by exporting the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` in
your shell's configuration file (by default, this is `~/.zshrc`):

```fish
export GITHUB_USER="<the value of your github username>"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<the value of oauth_token in ~/.config/hub>"
```

To verify that `GITHUB_TOKEN` works as expected, this example might prove
useful:

```shell
. ~/.zshrc
echo "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
echo "My first gist sent via hub" | hub gist create
```

### How to recover from mistakes/failures and start over

If something goes awry during a `ContributeRecipe` run, you might need to delete
the remote branch for subsequent `ContributeRecipe` attempts to be successful.

Once you know the name of the branch that was created, it's as simple as firing
off a `git push <remote> --delete <branch>` command.

Typically, for remote branches the necessary command will look something like
`git push origin-fork --delete submit-<recipe>-<version>`.

#### Example:

`git push origin-fork --delete submit-Python-2.7.18`
