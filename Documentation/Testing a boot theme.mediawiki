Fortunately you don't have to reboot your computer to test every feature you add to your boot theme. The [[TestBootTheme]] script is your friend. Just run it passing your boot script name as a parameter:

<pre>
TestBootTheme MyVeryOwnBootTheme
</pre>

This will simulate a boot procedure with lots of things getting executed. Some of them will be quiet, some will echo a lot of text, some will succeed, some will fail... Just press enter when it ends up at the "login" prompt to finish. If you don't give it a Theme name, it will output the list of available Themes from /Programs/[[BootScripts]]/Current/Themes/ instead.

Of course, this script is also useful to see how the various boot themes are, so that you can choose which one is your favorite.

Note: Some themes may not display correctly in an Xterm/Konsole/other graphical terminal, or with a non-standard console font. It's probably best to run TestBootTheme in the same environment you boot in!
