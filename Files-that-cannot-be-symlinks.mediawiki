Symbolic links play a major role in a GoboLinux system, but some programs don't behave as expected when they are used. This section lists the files that cannot be symlinks.

* /System/Settings/sudoers

The configuration file for ''sudo'' must be a regular file. If it is not, <code>sudo</code> will complain and do nothing.


* /System/Settings/passwd and friends

The settings files used by the Shadow package are quite interesting. Theoretically, they can be symlinks, but there is a caveat: utilities like useradd don't just modify these files; they remove and recreate them as regular files. Hence, in practice, they cannot be symbolic links.
